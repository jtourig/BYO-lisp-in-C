# some notes from ch2

basic debugging with lots of print output

programs which compile without errors / warnings are harder to debug

more advanced debugging with tool `gdb` [http://web.archive.org/web/20140910051410/http://www.dirac.org/linux/gdb/]
- powerful but tough to use
- OSX / macOS come with `lldb` instead, similar

linux and mac can also use `valgrind` [http://www.cprogramming.com/debugging/valgrind.html]
